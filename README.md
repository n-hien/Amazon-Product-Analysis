# Market-Research

<p style="font-style: italic">
I'm going to order earbuds as a Christmas gift for my friend. </br>
I will use reviews of other users on the Internet to analyze whether the product is good or not. </br>
Also, I will collect some data and create a price chart to determine at what price I should buy.</p>
